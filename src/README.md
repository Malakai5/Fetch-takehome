    # Fetch-rewards Receipt Processor
    Here is my attempt on the take-home challenge given by Fetch.

    ## Installation
    To begin running this code, the user must clone the repo into their own local directory and have Go installed on their device.
    Go can be downloaded at this website [Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

    ## Run
    The command "go run ." Can be ran from the "Fetch-Takehome" directory to begin listening on http://localhost:8080.

    ## Questions/Comments
    There seemed to be what looks to be an error in the examples that causes point assignment to be off. In the first example JSON supplied, the example said that the amount of items is "4 pairs which should return 10 points" If each item-pair is worth 2 points then the total should be 8 points. Even more confusing is that the example shows 5 item pairs which would return the correct amount of 10 points.

    In the next JSON example supplied, the example says that there are 4 item pairs which adds up to 10 points. If there are 4 item pairs then it should return 8 points making the point total of the 2nd example 107
